I am passionate about creating applications which solve problems that will impact users on a personal, meaningful level. There are many journaling, mood tracking, 
and mindfullness apps out there. I myself have used several. What makes my idea different is that the user will have access to all three features in one application. 
Specifically, people would use the app daily to track their moods, thoughts, etc. That information would then be used to suggest a meditation or mindfullness practice. 
When users create a profile, that information will be stored in their account and they will be able to review their moods over a period of time as well as meditations 
they have completed and other related statistics (minutes spent medi- tating, number of days with consecutive meditaiton, etc). Users with a profile can save meditations 
by adding them to a "favorites" list. The application offers a comprehensive solution for people who want to become more mindful but do not know where to start. Once
the user becomes more acquainted with the practice of mindfullness, the app will continue to be helpful by providing access to saved meditations and long term data 
on the users' mood/meditation habits over time.
